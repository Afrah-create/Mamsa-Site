# Public Image Assets

This directory stores shared imagery for the public-facing MAMSA site.

Current assets:

- `mamsa-logo.JPG` – official association logo used in the public navigation.
- `ivory tower2.jpeg` – hero/banner photography for the home page.
- `hero-illustration.svg` – legacy illustration kept for reference (can be removed once no longer needed).

Feel free to add optimised `.svg`, `.jpg`, or `.png` files for other sections (events, updates, leadership, etc.). Keep filenames lowercase with dashes, and prefer SVG for illustrations where possible.
